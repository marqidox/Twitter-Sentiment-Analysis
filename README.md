# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
This project conducts sentiment and subjectivity analysis on Twitter tweets to gain an understanding on the public's opinion on AI in education.
Create sentiment visualizations based on tweets to show public opinion on A.I. in education. Based on the general opinion, we can give policymakers a better idea on how to handle A.I. integration in schooling. I will use the pandas library in Python to analyze a database full of tweets regarding AI in education.
